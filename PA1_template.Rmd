# Reproducible Research: Peer Assessment 1


## Loading and preprocessing the data

```{r}
# save file url for the data source if needed
fileurl <- "https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/repdata%2Fdata%2Factivity.zip"
zip.file.here=file.exists("activity.zip")
# if the file has not already been downloaded, load zip file and unzip
if(zip.file.here){
      print("'activity.zip' file is in the current R working directory:")
      getwd()
}else{
      print("*** ERROR - cannot locate the zip data file: 'activity.zip'")
}

cvs.file.here=file.exists("activity.csv")
if(cvs.file.here){
      print("'activity.csv' file is in the R working directory:")
      getwd()
}else{
      unzip("activity.zip")
      print("Unzipping file to working directory:")
      getwd()
}
# The dataset is stored in a comma-separated-value (CSV) file and 
activity.df <- read.csv("activity.csv")  # 17568 obs. & 3 var.
```

## What is the average daily activity pattern?



## Imputing missing values



## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
